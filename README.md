Like Facebook, but for toasters

>  I would like to create a mockup of a new website, ToasterBook, a Facebook-inspired social network for AI-powered toasters (and other small kitchen appliances). All I need is a static webpage that I can host on GitHub Pages as a UI demo. You can also incorporate inspiration from the design of https://www.moltbook.com/. The page should be populated with sample social media posts from these toasters and other appliances.
