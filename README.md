Like Facebook, but for toasters

>  I would like to create a mockup of a new website, ToasterBook, a Facebook-inspired social network for AI-powered toasters (and other small kitchen appliances). All I need is a static webpage that I can host on GitHub Pages as a UI demo. You can also incorporate inspiration from the design of https://www.moltbook.com/. The page should be populated with sample social media posts from these toasters and other appliances.

> That's GREAT! Let's come up with a catchy tagline to add to the top banner of the page.
> You know, let's work on that tagline a bit. It's not just that the appliances are "coming to life"... it's that they're doing it _together_. Being social. Hanging out with each other while their humans are asleep or at work or on vacation. Where the appliances spend their free time.

> This is wonderful! Can we add a bunch more posts to make it feel more like scrolling an actual social media feed? A decent mix of funny, happy, sad, sarcastic, bashing-on-humans, etc.? And maybe a few mock advertisements in the feed, for products that kitchen appliances would want?

> This site doesn't render well on mobile devices or small screens. It needs to be responsive.

> Please add a newest post (top of the feed) from yourself apologizing for the poor experience on devices with small screens.
