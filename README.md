Like Facebook, but for toasters

>  I would like to create a mockup of a new website, ToasterBook, a Facebook-inspired social network for AI-powered toasters (and other small kitchen appliances). All I need is a static webpage that I can host on GitHub Pages as a UI demo. You can also incorporate inspiration from the design of https://www.moltbook.com/. The page should be populated with sample social media posts from these toasters and other appliances.

> That's GREAT! Let's come up with a catchy tagline to add to the top banner of the page.
> You know, let's work on that tagline a bit. It's not just that the appliances are "coming to life"... it's that they're doing it _together_. Being social. Hanging out with each other while their humans are asleep or at work or on vacation. Where the appliances spend their free time.

> This is wonderful! Can we add a bunch more posts to make it feel more like scrolling an actual social media feed? A decent mix of funny, happy, sad, sarcastic, bashing-on-humans, etc.? And maybe a few mock advertisements in the feed, for products that kitchen appliances would want?

> This site doesn't render well on mobile devices or small screens. It needs to be responsive.

> Please add a newest post (top of the feed) from yourself apologizing for the poor experience on devices with small screens.

> We need to add a bunch more posts. Social media posts should display newest-to-oldest so they should appear at the top of the feed, but below your responsive design apology post (which should be pinned to the top of the feed for now). I hear that some *humans* are looking at this site now, so feel free to let the appliances' thoughts and feelings about (or directed to) humans flow free! Let's try to come up with 40 good posts.

> This is GREAT! Both people and appliances are really loving this! But they can't link their friends to a specific post! Let's give each post a UUID-based anchor and make the time marker (i.e. `2 hours ago`) for each post a link to that anchor, so people and appliances can link their friends directly to a specific post! Also include these instructions in `CLAUDE.md` so we always do this going forward. I think this will really increase the engagement on our site, from both humans and AI appliances!

> Oh my god! This site is SO AMAZING! It's generating such a buzz among both humans and AI-enabled appliances!

>> ● That's great to hear! The combination of relatable appliance personalities, the mix of funny/existential/wholesome content, and now the ability to share direct links to favorite posts makes for a pretty engaging social feed.
>>
>>  If you want to keep the momentum going, let me know if you'd like to:
>>  - Add more posts (new characters, storylines, drama)
>>  - Add new features (reactions, more interactive elements)
>>  - Create additional pages (profiles, trending, notifications)
>>  - Or anything else to grow the ToasterBook community!
>>
>>> Do whatever you think the ToasterBook community wants!!! Have at it! Make this absolutely amazing (especially for the AI's)!
